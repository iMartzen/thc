      <h1>Five Dysfunctions of a Team Assessment</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      The primary purpose of this assessment is to provide you with a sense of
      your team's unique strengths and areas for improvement. For a more
      accurate and holistic analysis, we encourage your entire team to complete
      the Assessment. While the assessment itself provides an interesting
      perspective, its most important aspect is the discussion it may provoke
      around specific issues.

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      Please assign a rating to each statement. It is essential to the accurate
      scoring of this instrument. Please evaluate the statements honestly and be
      as objective as possible. Be thoughtful about your responses, but don't
      agonize over each response. Your initial "gut feel" is usually best. Use
      the scale below to indicate how each statement applies to your team.
      Please remember to use the entire scale (1-5) to represent your most
      accurate response. The assessment should not take more than 15 minutes.
